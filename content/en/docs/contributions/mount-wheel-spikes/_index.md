There are two YardForce spikes on Amazon (and other sites like Etsy): [Mibrobo](https://www.mibrobo.de/product/yardforce-classic-500-models-184-mibrobo-blackline-spikes-incl-wheel-extension-eng/119) and [RoboClaws](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1009079264/lawn-robot-spikes-for-yardforce-robotics).
This photo guide is about RoboClaws. 

In short:
 * remove wheels
 * (optionally) pre-drill holes, but people reported success even without that
 * attach spikes from inside
 * assemble back

Results:
 * much better traction on grass
 * noise on paving
 * probable damage to tiles
